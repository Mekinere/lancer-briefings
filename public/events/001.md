# Harrison Armory Farragut-Class "Ishimura" // 2.25.5023u

Rendezvous successful. Vanguard consists of pilots **MARS**, **SCOCK**, **JEEBS**, **WRATH**, and **HACK Z**. En route to system Columbia-2.

Rocky entry to atmosphere on northern hemisphere on Outpost 40-021 **SKIFF**. Heavy electrical storms disabled sensors, resulting in crash into nearby mountain range. Mech Hangar suffered catastrophic failure, Mech storage containers have touched down 3 miles out near small settlement at base of mountain range. **UNION** is ~~up our ass~~ ensuring the 3 pillars are being upheld in this excursion after a recent incident, so keep actions in *Sterstone* clean with minimal collateral damage.
