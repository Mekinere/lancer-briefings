# Mission // #001
## Search and Rescue
# Goals
- ~~Land safely on Skiff near **Sterstone**~~
- Recover Mech Hangar from base of mountain and rendezvous with HA's recovery fleet.
- Clear **Sterstone** of insurgents with minimal losses.

# Stakes
- Without a proper vanguard, sending an asset recovery team would be too dangerous to merit the cost. No mechs, no recovery.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
